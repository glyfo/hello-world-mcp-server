# Email Revolution: AI Digital Workers Using MCP, Resend, and Cloudflare

> Eliminate inbox overload with intelligent AI-powered email assistants

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent email digital worker using Model Context Protocol (MCP), Cloudflare Durable Objects, and the Resend email API. The digital worker can compose, send, and manage emails autonomously, dramatically reducing the time your team spends on email-related tasks.

## The Email Problem

The average professional spends 28% of their workday—that's 11+ hours weekly—just managing their inbox. For executives, that number jumps to nearly 40%.

This email digital worker solution helps you reclaim those lost hours by:

- Composing and sending emails autonomously
- Processing incoming communications intelligently
- Maintaining context across entire conversation threads
- Operating 24/7 without requiring human supervision

## Key Technologies

This project leverages three powerful technologies:

1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Enables AI models to interact directly with applications and services
2. **Cloudflare Durable Objects**: Provides stateful serverless computing with efficient hibernation
3. **Resend Email API**: Delivers reliable, trackable email communications

## Features

- ✅ **AI-Powered Email Composition**: Generate contextually appropriate email content
- ✅ **Autonomous Sending**: Schedule and send emails without human intervention
- ✅ **Stateful Conversations**: Maintain context across multiple interactions
- ✅ **Cost Efficiency**: Hibernation support means you only pay when actively processing
- ✅ **Enterprise Security**: Bearer token authentication and secure API integration
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed activity tracking for monitoring and debugging

## Implementation

The core of the implementation is an MCP server with Durable Objects for maintaining state:

```javascript
import { McpAgent } from "agents/mcp";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";
import { Resend } from "resend";

// Define the digital worker
export class EmailWorker extends McpAgent<Bindings, State, Props> {
  server = new McpServer({
    name: "EmailAssistant",
    version: "1.0.0",
  });

  async init() {
    // Set up the email sending capability
    this.server.tool(
      "sendEmail",
      {
        to: z.string().email(),
        subject: z.string(),
        body: z.string()
      },
      async ({ to, subject, body }) => {
        try {
          const resend = new Resend(this.env.API_KEY);
          const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
            from: "your-brand@company.com",
            to,
            subject,
            text: body,
          });

          if (error) {
            return { content: [{ type: "text", text: `Failed: ${error.message}` }] };
          }

          return { content: [{ type: "text", text: `Email sent successfully!` }] };
        } catch (err) {
          return { content: [{ type: "text", text: `Error: ${err.message}` }] };
        }
      }
    );
  }
}
```
